# DSP

This github contains the code from the paper XX..

Our code requires:
1) Python 3.6 or higher.
2) Jupyter-notebook working with python 3.6 for the artificial experiment.
3) Access to a unix/linux server to run parallel jobs. We use the engineering cluster Savio at UC, Berkeley to run the experiments (https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/user-guide/savio-user-guide).
